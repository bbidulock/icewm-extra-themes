1.2             Maintenance Release 1.2

    This is another release of the icewm-extra-themes package that contains
    a set of extra themes for IceWM that were too numerous to include in
    the base IceWM release. The purpose is to provide an adequate
    replacement for the Debian icewm-themes package and to act as a source
    of themes for distro maintainers of IceWM to select from when building
    and installing IceWM.

    This release is a maintenance release whose sole purpose is to update
    the build system, generate a better NEWS file, handle annotated tags
    better, and converts the release archives to lzip compression.

    Included in the release is an autoconf tarball for building the package
    from source. See the NEWS and TODO file in the release for more
    information. Please report problems to the issues list on GitHub.
