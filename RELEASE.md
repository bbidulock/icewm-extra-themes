[icewm-extra-themes -- release notes.  2019-08-31]: #

Maintenance Release 1.2
=======================

This is another release of the icewm-extra-themes package that contains
a set of extra themes for IceWM that were too numerous to include in the
base IceWM release.  The purpose is to provide an adequate replacement
for the Debian icewm-themes package and to act as a source of themes for
distro maintainers of IceWM to select from when building and installing
IceWM.

This release is a maintenance release whose sole purpose is to update
the build system, generate a better NEWS file, handle annotated tags
better, and converts the release archives to lzip compression.

Included in the release is an autoconf tarball for building the package
from source.  See the [NEWS](NEWS) and [TODO](TODO) file in the release
for more information.  Please report problems to the issues list on
[GitHub](https://github.com/bbidulock/icewm-extra-themes/issues).
