[Jan 5 1999]
    - changed frameAR and frameAL to just be a flipped version of frameAT
      -- the windows look a little more interesting now. :)
    - fixed up frameIR, frameIB -- they used to be the same as the frameAR
      and frameAB... I don't know how that escaped me, but for some reason
      it did. :)

[Jan 4 1999]
    - added a little thing that gets rid of the icons in the topleft of the
      window [ShowMenuButtonIcon = 0].. (Thanks to Shaji N V)
    - more graphical changes will be put on hold for a while as school starts
      back up :)
